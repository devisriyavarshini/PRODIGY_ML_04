# Hand Gesture Recognition

## Overview  
Hand Gesture Recognition is a computer vision project that identifies and classifies hand gestures from images.  
This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with **TensorFlow/Keras** to train a model on gesture datasets and predict unseen test images.

## How It Works  

### 1. Dataset Preparation  
- Training images are organized into class-wise folders.  
- Data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shift, flip) improves generalization.  
- Dataset is split into **training** and **validation** sets.  

### 2. Model Architecture  
- **Conv2D Layers** → Extract visual features (edges, shapes, textures).  
- **MaxPooling2D** → Reduces dimensionality while retaining features.  
- **Dense Layers** → Learn high-level gesture representations.  
- **Output Layer** → Predicts gesture class.  

### 3. Training  
- Optimizer: **Adam**  
- Loss: **Binary Crossentropy** (can switch to `categorical_crossentropy` for multi-class).  
- Metric: **Accuracy**  
- Model trained for **10 epochs** with validation monitoring.  

### 4. Testing & Predictions  
- Test images are preprocessed (resized & normalized).  
- Trained model generates predictions.  
- Predictions are saved in **`submissions.csv`**.

## Results  
- Model achieves good validation accuracy.  
- Predictions for unseen test images are correctly generated.

## Conclusion  
This project shows that **CNNs can effectively recognize hand gestures** from images.  
Such systems can be applied in:  
- Gesture-controlled devices  
- Sign language recognition  
- Robotics  
- AR/VR interactive systems

## Future Improvements  
- Use **categorical crossentropy** for better multi-class handling.  
- Apply **transfer learning** (VGG16, ResNet, MobileNet).  
- Extend to **real-time webcam-based gesture recognition**.
